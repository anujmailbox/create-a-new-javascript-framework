# [Create a New JavaScript Framework: Full Stack Reactivity with Milo][published url]
## Instructor: [Jason Green][instructor url]

Milojs is the reactive framework used to create the CMS of the Mail Onlineâ€”the world's most popular English-language online newspaper. Milojs allows us to seamlessly connect data sources together, including models, model paths, and the DOM. As you'll see in this course, we can take this connection one step further to create a full stack reactive connection with WebSockets.

In this Coffee Break Course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jason Green will demonstrate the power of Milojs by working through a fully functional Slack clone chat application. You'll see how Milojs makes this possible with very little server code. 

This is the third course in a series about Milojs, its architecture, and the challenges of building it. In the first course, [How We Built the Daily Mail CMS](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/create-a-new-javascript-framework-how-we-built-the-daily-mail-cms), Jason introduced the framework, explaining the motivations for creating it and demonstrating some of its most powerful features. In the second course, [Challenges of Rolling Your Own](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/create-a-new-javascript-framework-challenges-of-rolling-your-own), Jason talks about some of the technical and interpersonal challenges his team faced.
