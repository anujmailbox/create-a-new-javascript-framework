# [Create a New JavaScript Framework][published url]
## Instructor: [Jason Green][instructor url]

The Daily Mail Online is the world's most popular English-language online newspaper, with some 200 million unique monthly visitors and around 900 new articles published daily. With this volume of content, posting an article needs to be as smooth and intuitive as possible, with a completely inline WYSIWYG editing experience and an easy drag-and-drop approach to images, videos, tables and other graphical elements.

In this short course, Daily Mail developer Jason Green will tell you all about Milojs: the Daily Mail's homegrown JavaScript framework that powers their high-volume news site. He'll tell you all about the reasons the Daily Mail team decided to roll their own framework and introduce some of the features that set Milo apart from other existing frameworks. You'll also see how to implement a fully functional Slack-like chat application with very little server code. 

Not all of the challenges in development are technical, however. Jason will also be looking at some of the interpersonal issues the team faced, and how they resolved disagreements within the team and got new team members up to speed with a custom framework.

The three lessons of this course were originally published as a series of Coffee Break Courses.
